      Introduction to Symbol
ES6 introduces a new primitive type called Symbol. They are helpful to implement 
metaprogramming in JavaScript programs.
Syntax
const mySymbol = Symbol()
const mySymbol = Symbol(stringDescription)
A symbol is just a piece of memory in which you can store some data. Each symbol will 
point to a different memory location. Values returned by a Symbol() constructor are 
unique and immutable.
Example
Let us understand this through an example. Initially, we created two symbols without 
description followed by symbols with same description. In both the cases the equality 
operator will return false when the symbols are compared.
<script>
 const s1 = Symbol();
 const s2 = Symbol();
 console.log(typeof s1)
 console.log(s1===s2)
 const s3 = Symbol("hello");//description
 const s4 = Symbol("hello");
 console.log(s3)
 console.log(s4)
 console.log(s3==s4)
</script>
The output of the above code will be as mentioned below: 
symbol
false
